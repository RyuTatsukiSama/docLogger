# rLogger

## Description

This is a logger project made by RyuTatsukiSama ( and a lot of help from Epharos üôè ) made for C++ with CMake.

For now if you want to use it import the files of the " src " folder in your project, or you can open the project with CMake to compile the files into a .lib file and add it to your project.

## Futures Update

- Writing all the unit test
- Documentations ( will be available [here](https://github.com/RyuTatsukiSama/rLogger/blob/main/Documentation.md) )
- Commentary in the code
- Make a realease to make it easy to download it
- Make it a .dll instead of a .lib
- Export the rLogger in other languages
- Multi os support
- Stacktrace when c++ 23 will be available
